# PHPStan Extension for RegexParser
# 
# This extension can be enhanced with custom rules for validating regex patterns
# in preg_* function calls. Currently, this is a placeholder for future development.
#
# Example future rule:
# services:
#     -
#         class: RegexParser\PHPStan\PregValidationRule
#         tags:
#             - phpstan.rules.rule

services: []
