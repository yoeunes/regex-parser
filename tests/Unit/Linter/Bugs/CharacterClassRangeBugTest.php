/**
 * Regression tests for the character class range optimization bug.
 *
 * This test ensures that the optimizer does NOT create ranges (e.g., `A-C`)
 * when merging characters unless ALL intermediate characters are present
 * in the original pattern.
 *
 * Bug description:
 * The optimizer was incorrectly creating ranges when merging characters,
 * even if intermediate characters were NOT present in the original pattern.
 * This effectively broadened the regex matching rules, breaking user logic.
 *
 * Examples of incorrect behavior (now fixed):
 * - Input: `[+-\/]` (matches literals `+`, `-`, `/`)
 *   Bad output: `[+-/]` (would match range `+` through `/`, including `,` and `.`)
 * - Input: `[@\]]` (matches literals `@`, `]`)
 *   Bad output: `[@-\]]` (would match range `@` through `]`, including `A-Z`, `[`, `\`)
 *
 * The optimization must be strictly equivalent:
 * - `[AC]` must NEVER become `[A-C]`
 * - Only `[ABC]` can become `[A-C]`
