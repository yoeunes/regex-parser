## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within RegexParser (e.g., a pattern that crashes the parser or causes an infinite loop in the parser itself), please send an e-mail to **younes.ennaji.pro@gmail.com**.

**Do not open a public issue** for security vulnerabilities.

We will respond as quickly as possible to acknowledge your report and work with you to resolve the issue.
