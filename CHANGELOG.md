# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Alphabetic assertion verbs (PCRE2 10.32+): `(*pla:...)`, `(*positive_lookahead:...)`, `(*nla:...)`, `(*plb:...)`, `(*nlb:...)`, `(*negative_lookbehind:...)`, `(*atomic:...)` parse as their classic lookaround / atomic group equivalents.
- Script run content is now parsed into the AST: `(*sr:(a+)+b)` is analyzed like any sub-pattern (its catastrophic backtracking is detected by the ReDoS engine, its length/complexity contribute to metrics).
- `Regex::parseTolerant()` — explicit tolerant parsing without the `parse($regex, true)` bool-flag union return.
- `OutputFormat` enum accepted by `Regex::explain()` and `Regex::highlight()` (strings still work).

### Deprecated
- `Regex::new()` (identical to `Regex::create()`); `ValidationResult::isValid()` and `getErrorMessage()` methods in favor of the public `$isValid` / `$error` properties.

### Added
- **Laravel bridge** (`RegexParser\Bridge\Laravel`) with package auto-discovery:
  - Service provider and `Regex` facade
  - Artisan commands: `regex:lint`, `regex:routes`, `regex:explain`, `regex:compare`, `regex:transpile`
  - Pattern extractors for route `where()` constraints and `regex:`/`not_regex:` validation rules
  - Publishable configuration (`config/regex-parser.php`)
  - No new runtime dependencies — `illuminate/*` packages are suggested only
- **Language Server Protocol (LSP) support** via `bin/regex-lsp` for real-time regex analysis in IDEs.
  - Real-time diagnostics (parse errors, validation issues, lint warnings)
  - Hover information with pattern explanations
  - Code actions for quick fixes (add `/u` flag, apply optimizations)
  - Completion support for regex syntax (character classes, anchors, quantifiers, groups, Unicode properties, POSIX classes, flags)
  - Works with VS Code, Neovim, Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Helix, Zed, and PhpStorm (via LSP4IJ plugin)
- **Unicode awareness lint checks** (3 new rules):
  - `regex.lint.unicode.shorthandWithoutU` (Style): Warns when `\w`, `\d`, `\s` used without `/u` flag
  - `regex.lint.unicode.propertyWithoutU` (Error): Error when `\p{L}` used without `/u` flag
  - `regex.lint.unicode.bracedHexWithoutU` (Error): Error when `\x{100}` used without `/u` flag for code points > U+FF
- **Configurable lint rules** via `checks.lint` in `regex.json`/`regex.dist.json`:
  - Enable/disable individual lint rules (32 rules available)
  - Configuration schema with all rule IDs and default values
  - CLI flags: `--lint`/`--no-lint`, `--enable-rule=<id>`, `--disable-rule=<id>`
- CLI `--redos` flag to explicitly enable ReDoS analysis (counterpart to `--no-redos`).

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: ReDoS analysis is now disabled by default for better performance. Enable explicitly via:
  - CLI: `--redos` flag or `checks.redos.enabled: true` in `regex.json`
  - PHPStan: `reportRedos: true` in rule configuration
  - Symfony: `regex_parser.redos.enabled: true` in bundle configuration
- **BREAKING**: `unicode.shorthandWithoutU` lint rule is now disabled by default to reduce noise. Most PHP codebases intentionally use ASCII-only matching. Enable via:
  - CLI: `--enable-rule=unicode.shorthandWithoutU`
  - Config: `checks.lint.rules.unicode.shorthandWithoutU: true` in `regex.json`
- **BREAKING**: Lint identifiers now use camelCase instead of snake_case for PHPStan compatibility:
  - `regex.lint.unicode.shorthand_without_u` → `regex.lint.unicode.shorthandWithoutU`
  - `regex.lint.alternation.duplicate_disjunction` → `regex.lint.alternation.duplicateDisjunction`
  - `regex.lint.charclass.duplicate_chars` → `regex.lint.charclass.duplicateChars`
  - `regex.lint.charclass.suspicious_range` → `regex.lint.charclass.suspiciousRange`
  - `regex.lint.charclass.suspicious_pipe` → `regex.lint.charclass.suspiciousPipe`
- Symfony bundle `redos.enabled` configuration option (defaults to `false`).
- Lint configuration `checks` section with nested ReDoS and optimization settings (schema + defaults).
- PHPStan extension support for `checks` configuration overrides.
- Lint check for backreference-as-octal in character classes: `[^\1]` is treated as octal `\x01`, not a backreference — warns when a corresponding capturing group exists.
- Lint check for literal metacharacters in character classes: `[\w+]` where `+`, `*`, `?` are literals, not quantifiers. Skips negated classes and multi-element sets (3+ other elements) to avoid false positives on URI schemes, Base64, etc.
- Lint check for `(.|\n)` anti-pattern: suggests using the `s` (DOTALL) flag or `[\s\S]` instead.
- Lint check for quantified capturing groups: `(?<name>\d+)+` warns that only the last iteration's capture is retained. Named groups report as Warning; anonymous groups report as Info.
- `CharSet::contains()` now uses binary search over sorted ranges, reducing lookup from O(n) to O(log n) on the determinization hot path.

### Changed
- Deprecated legacy lint config keys (`rules`, `redosMode`, `redosThreshold`, `redosNoJit`, `optimizations`, `minSavings`) in favor of `checks.*`.
- `SecurityAccessControlAnalyzer` now uses `MatchMode::FULL` instead of `MatchMode::PARTIAL`, avoiding redundant NFA self-loops since patterns are already manually wrapped with `.*` by `normalizeSearchPattern()`.
- `RegexSolver::findExample()` product-automaton BFS now uses integer pair keys instead of string concatenation, reducing allocation overhead during DFA intersection/subset/equivalence checks.

### Removed
- Dead `HelpfulExceptionTrait` (~430 lines, referenced nowhere).

### Fixed
- `--generate-baseline` combined with `--baseline` now writes a baseline covering the full report; previously issues suppressed by the old baseline silently vanished from the newly generated one.
- The AST cache key now always includes the effective PHP version, so a cache directory shared across PHP upgrades cannot serve ASTs parsed under a different version.
- Non-UTF-8 (byte-mode) patterns like `"@^[ \t!-~\x80-\xFF]*$@"` are now tokenized byte by byte and analyzed, exactly as PCRE compiles them without the `u` modifier, instead of being rejected with "Input string is not valid UTF-8". Combining invalid UTF-8 with the `u` flag still errors, like PCRE.
- Unicode conformance: `\o{...}` above 0xFF is accepted under `/u` (any valid codepoint) and rejected without it; `\N{U+hhhh}` is now actually lexed as a codepoint escape (it was silently parsed as literal text), requires the `u` flag like PCRE, and resolves its codepoint directly; `\p{L}` end positions are no longer off by two bytes; `\P{...}` compiles back byte-identically instead of being rewritten to `\p{^...}`.
- PCRE conformance (validated differentially against the real engine): quoted references `\g'1'` / `\k'name'` and relative subroutine calls `\g<-1>`, `\g<+1>`, `(?+1)` are now accepted; a quantifier after `\Q...\E` applies to the quoted literal (`/\Q+\E*/`); `\c` at end of pattern, empty `\x{}`, quantifiers above 65535 (`a{65536}`), invalid group names (`(?<a-b>x)`), and unbalanced bracket delimiters (`{a{b}`) are now rejected like PCRE does.
- Parser exceptions from named-Unicode validation and pattern-level flag errors now carry the pattern, position, and caret snippet like every other error.
- Visitors now cover every AST node type: `CompilerNodeVisitor` no longer silently drops `UnicodeNode` from compiled patterns; `MetricsNodeVisitor` counts class operations, control chars, script runs, and version conditionals; `ModernizerNodeVisitor` passes `UnicodeNode` through. A synthetic all-node exhaustiveness test guards every visitor against future node additions.
- CLI lint config now honors `verifyWithAutomata` when provided in optimization settings.
- **Visitor crashes on newer node types**: visitors with typed returns (`optimize()`, `literals()`, `generate()`, complexity scoring, length ranges, HTML explain, test-case generation) crashed with a `TypeError` on patterns containing control chars (`\cA`), class operations (`[a&&b]`), script runs (`(*sr:...)`), or version conditionals (`(?(VERSION>=...))`). `validate('/\cA/')` also wrongly reported valid patterns as invalid. All visitors now handle every node type; a new exhaustiveness test guards against future drift.
- **`ArrayCache` never returned cached ASTs**: it stored the raw cache payload string, which the facade discarded on every load — every parse re-parsed from scratch while hit counters incremented. Payloads are now decoded once at write time (shared `CachePayloadDecoder`, also used by the PSR-6/PSR-16 adapters).
- **Compiler double-wrapped POSIX classes**: `/[[:alpha:]]/` compiled to `/[[[:alpha:]]]/`, changing match semantics. Also affected ReDoS `vulnerablePattern` output.
- **Lint extractor "repaired" broken delimiters**: `preg_match("/foo#", ...)` — a runtime error in PHP — was silently extracted as `/foo/` and passed lint. Mismatched delimiters are now reported as errors.
- **ReDoS analysis skipped conditional conditions**: `/(?(?=(a+)+b)x|y)/` was rated safe; the condition lookaround is now analyzed (rated critical).
- **Sample generator produced non-matching samples**: negated classes always returned `'!'` (impossible for e.g. `/[^!"#]/`); lookbehind suffix hints used substring instead of suffix matching. `generate()` now verifies samples against the real engine and retries.
- **Backreference/octal disambiguation now follows PCRE**: `(a)\11` is the octal escape `\011` (TAB), not an invalid backreference; `\19` is octal `\1` + literal `9`; `\81` remains an error. Previously all multi-digit `\NN` were treated as backreferences and wrongly rejected.

### Changed
- **Unified quantifier parsing** via a new `QuantifierBounds` value object. Previously ~20 inline re-implementations disagreed: `{,5}` meant "0 to 5" to the validator but "exactly once" to the length/lint analyzers and "never" to the sample generator; `{ 2 }` (extended mode) was only understood by the validator. All visitors (length ranges, ReDoS, linter, sample/test-case generators, optimizer, explain, railroad) now share one canonical parser.
- **Stricter (PCRE-conformant) character class ranges**: a character type, POSIX class, or Unicode property can no longer be a range endpoint. Patterns like `[\w-_]`, `[\d-z]`, `[a-\d]` — which PCRE rejects at compile time — now fail to parse instead of being silently re-interpreted with a literal hyphen. Literal hyphens at class edges (`[-a]`, `[\d-]`) are unaffected.

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive LSP integration guide (`docs/guides/lsp.md`) with configuration for VS Code, PhpStorm (LSP4IJ), Neovim, Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Helix, and Zed.
- Updated CLI configuration examples to use `checks` and note deprecated keys.

### Tests
- Added comprehensive LSP server test suite (97 tests) covering Protocol, Handlers, Document management, and Converters.
- Added Unicode lint rules tests covering all shorthand patterns and Unicode properties.
- Added coverage for `checks` normalization and PHPStan `checks` overrides.
- Added data-provider coverage for backreference-as-octal, literal metacharacter, dot-newline anti-pattern, and quantified capturing group lint checks.
- Added `CharSetContainsTest` covering binary search: single points, ranges, empty/full sets, complement, union, intersection, subtraction, Unicode code points, and many-ranges stress test.
- Added `RegexSolverEdgeCaseTest` covering identical patterns, empty languages, case-insensitive equivalence, char class shorthands (`\d`, `\w`, `\s`), `.*` subset, quantifier equivalences, alternation commutativity/distributivity, both determinization algorithms, DFA cache reuse, and dotall flag equivalence.
- Added `DfaMinimizerRangesTest` covering range-based transitions, range preservation in minimized output, single-state DFA, and all-accepting state merging for both Hopcroft and Moore algorithms.
- Added `SecurityAccessControlMatchModeTest` verifying `MatchMode::FULL` correctness for prefix shadowing, unanchored paths, regex paths, disjoint paths/methods, equivalent/redundant rules, empty paths, and fully anchored paths.

- Debug command now shows a syntax-highlighted pattern block alongside the heatmap output.
- Highlight/parse/analyze/validate/diagram/self-update/version/clear-cache/help outputs now use the shared console presentation style.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-01-03

- Tests to verify suspicious ASCII range `A-z` detection (includes non-letter characters between Z and a).

### Fixed
- Corrected suspicious ASCII range detection to properly identify `A-z` as including non-letter characters (`[ \ ] ^ _ \` `) and recommend `A-Za-z` instead.
- Linter now correctly skips unparseable regex patterns in test extraction to prevent crashes.
- Improved corpus log generation to include accurate pattern column and file offset metadata.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- Lint results now include pattern columns and file offsets to disambiguate multiple patterns on the same line.

### Changed
- Default lint excludes now skip `vendor`, `tests`, and `Fixtures` in the CLI and Symfony bridge configuration.

- ReDoS empty-repeat severity is downgraded for recursive patterns with possess/atomic branches.

### Tests
- Added coverage for token-based and PHPStan extraction column/offset metadata, inline-flag sequencing, lookaround alternations, and Symfony route requirement patterns.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- Python named group syntax preservation: `(?P<name>...)` syntax is now preserved when parsing and compiling regex patterns instead of being converted to `(?<name>...)`.
- Added `usePythonSyntax` property to `GroupNode` to track original named group syntax.
- Added `Style` and `Perf` severity levels to the `Severity` enum for categorizing lint issues.
- Added `severity` property to `LintIssue` class for categorizing issues by severity level.

### Changed
- Linter now only flags overlapping alternation warnings when the alternation is inside an unbounded quantifier (e.g., `+`, `*`, `{n,}`), reducing false positives for safe patterns like `/\r\n|\r|\n/` and `/^(978|979)/`.
- Improved heuristic for detecting alternations inside unbounded quantifiers to properly handle nested parentheses.

### Fixed
- Fixed false positive overlap warnings for patterns without quantifiers that don't pose ReDoS risk.
- Fixed pretty-print mode in `CompilerNodeVisitor` to output correct regex syntax for lookaheads (`(?=`), lookbehinds (`(?<!`), atomic groups (`(?>`), branch resets (`(?|`), and inline flags (`(?im:`).
- Built the `/r` modifier probe regex dynamically to avoid static regex validation false positives.

### Tests
- Updated `LinterRulesTest::test_alternation_overlap_warning` to use pattern with unbounded quantifier.
- Updated `OptimizerTest` to expect Python syntax preservation.
- Updated `CompilerNodeVisitorCoverageTest` to expect correct regex syntax in pretty-print mode.
- Reworked formatter and visitor coverage tests to assert behavior, and added coverage for JSON payload normalization and validator errors.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- Added a formatter benchmark script to measure lint output throughput and memory usage.
- Added atomic-group tip suggestions for nested-quantifier and dot-star lint warnings.

### Documentation

- Documented the `suggestedPattern` lint issue field in diagnostics reference.

### Changed
- Optimizer now reuses a compiler visitor while resetting its state between string conversions.
- Lint output formatters now assemble output using buffered chunks for large reports.
- PHPStan pattern truncation now relies on a named constant.
- Suspicious ASCII range warnings now describe the ASCII-order endpoints of the reported range.
- Atomic-group lint suggestions are now validated before being emitted.
- Extended-mode optimization tips now diff against a normalized baseline to avoid mixing raw formatting with pretty-printed suggestions.

### Tests

- Added coverage for compiler state resets between compilations.
- Added coverage for the PHPStan truncation default length.
- Added coverage for lint suggestion tips and the updated ASCII range message.
- Added coverage for escaped dollar literals, char-class group-like tokens, and extended-mode optimization baselines.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- ReDoS analysis now detects empty-match repetitions and ambiguous adjacent quantifiers.
- Suggested rewrites are surfaced for the highest-severity ReDoS finding.
- Linter warns about suspicious ASCII ranges like `[A-z]` and alternation-like character classes such as `[error|failure]`.

### Changed
- Optimizer now respects Unicode mode when merging digit classes and cleans up unused multiline flags.
- Optimizer can reduce negated digit/word classes to `\D`/`\W` and applies safer auto-possessify rules.
- Linter now recognizes escaped literals and Unicode property classes when evaluating case-sensitive flags, and validates `\g{n}` backreferences and anchor assertions more consistently.
- Optimizer avoids creating new character-class ranges that start or end with `-` unless the range was explicit in the original pattern.
- Highlighter visitors now cover all AST nodes, preserve inline comment text, and emit richer HTML token classes with updated console colors.

### Fixed
- Lint output now properly escapes special characters in alternation branch literals to prevent display issues.

### Tests
- Expanded the ReDoS test suite with real-world patterns and mitigation cases.
- Added optimizer coverage for Unicode handling, negated classes, auto-possessify safety, and flag cleanup.
- Added a corpus-driven linter regression suite plus new unit coverage for Unicode escapes, property flags, anchor assertions, and `\g{}` backreferences.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- Optimization option `minQuantifierCount` to control when repeats are compacted into `{n}`.

### Fixed
- Optimizer now preserves explicit fixed quantifiers (e.g., `\d{2}`) instead of expanding them into repeated literals.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- Regression coverage for optimized character class ranges that include the delimiter.

### Fixed
- Character class compilation now preserves literal `[` where safe and escapes delimiters to prevent invalid ranges.
- Lexer tests updated to reflect literal `[` handling inside character classes.
- Linter anchor checks now reindex sliced sequences to satisfy static analysis.
